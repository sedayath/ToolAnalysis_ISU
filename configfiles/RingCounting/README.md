# RingCounting
**********************

A ToolChain that classifies (MC) events as Single- or Multi-Ring. The RingCounting tool can also be used as
a stand-alone tool, when loading events from csv files, produced by the CNNImage tool. 

All other tools used in the tool chain are prerequisites for the CNNImage tool.

See UserTools/RingCounting and UserTools/CNNImage for more information.
