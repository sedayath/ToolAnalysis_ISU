UseLEDWaveforms 0            # specifies whether to show or save full waveforms from the DAQ or the LED waveform windows

OutputFile test              # Base filename given to both the ROOT and txt file that are output from the tool

SaveWaveforms 1              # Determines whether or not to save raw waveforms in the output ROOT file

WavesWithPulsesOnly 1        # Controls whether or not to save only waveforms that have a pulse in them (determined by the hit finding tools)

MaxWaveforms 1000            # Controls the number of raw waveforms to be saved to the output ROOT file. Used to keep the ROOT file from exploding under the sheer number of raw waveforms saved
